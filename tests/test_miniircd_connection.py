Integration tests for miniircd server functionality.

This module contains tests that verify the basic IRC protocol implementation
of the miniircd server, including connection handling, user registration,
channel joining, and message exchange.

Tests are designed to be run against a local miniircd instance and verify
both client-server interactions and server-side behavior.
